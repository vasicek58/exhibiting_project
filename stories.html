He just had his flute lesson, so he was carrying his instrument and some music sheet in his backpack. When he arrived and rang the bell, it took some time before anyone responded, and surprisingly, his friend’s sister came to open the gate to the garden. When they got in, he heard his friend’s voice from behind, saying “but really do that, okay?”, apparently addressing his sister. He felt somehow weak, thinking they hold some secret against him, but he said nothing and soon forgot that they may be plotting something. A little later, they were sitting in the garden, talking, when suddenly the two siblings asked him if he could play something with his flute for them. Not having any suspicion, he took out his instrument and music sheet and started playing an etude he was practicing for today’s lesson. Instead of listening, however, they started laughing at him frantically, pointing their fingers and making a fool of him. He immediately felt dizzy, as if something was clutching his chest, his body felt stiff, but his fingers still somehow managed to move and play. He went on playing and tried to concentrate, the sound of his flute along with the laughter of those two kids creating this weird mixture of sharp, high-pitched sounds, until he finished this etude. After it all calmed down, he packed back his things and went home to talk to his mother. </p></div>
